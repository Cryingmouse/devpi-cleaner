will remove the specified versions of a package from all indices of a given user.

Use Cases
=========

* Removing outdated development packages
* Removing packages uploaded by accident
* Removing packages available from other indices

Example Usage
=============

The following command will delete all development packages preceding version 4.0 of ``some_package`` in indices of
the user::
